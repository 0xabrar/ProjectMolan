			 <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">About Optiol</h2>
			
			 
			 <p>Optiol is a website used to search for, and find, odd jobs in the community.
			 This can include jobs such as lawn mowing, grocery delivery, wall-painting, or anything
			 along those lines that the user base wants done. This could be a great
			 way to find someone to do that job you need to get done, but don't really want to do!
			 At the same time, workers will find that over time they've built up a listing of jobs
			 they've completed with rated feedbacks.   </p>
			 
			 <p>As of the present, Optiol is still in the development phase, so some site features
			 may not be available. If you're waiting on a certain feature,be sure to check the back for changes.  
			 Optio is being built from scratch and not using pre-existing web tools, so this may take a while.</p>
			 
			 <p>If you have questions or would like to suggest some changes, be sure to use the contact page and 
			 we'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
